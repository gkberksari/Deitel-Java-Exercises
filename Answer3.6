A constructor is similar to method and it is invoked at the time creating an object of the class, it is generally used to
initialize the instance variables of a class. The constructors have same name as their class and, have no return type.

If a class has only a default constructor, types are initialize as follows:
int: 0
double: 0.0
boolean: false
char: \u0000
String: null
