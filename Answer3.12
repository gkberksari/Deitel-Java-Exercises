(Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent
an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as
instance variables—a part number (type String), a part description (type String), a quantity of the
item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double). Your class should have a constructor
that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e.,
multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the
quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to
0.0. Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.






public class Invoice {
    
    private String partnumber;
    private String description;
    private int quantity_of_purchase;
    private double price;
    
    public Invoice(String partnumber, String description, int quantity_of_purchase, double price){
        
        this.partnumber = partnumber;
        this.description = description;
        this.quantity_of_purchase = quantity_of_purchase;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getPartnumber() {
        return partnumber;
    }

    public void setPartnumber(String partnumber) {
        this.partnumber = partnumber;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public int getQuantity_of_purchase() {
        return quantity_of_purchase;
    }

    public void setQuantity_of_purchase(int quantity_of_purchase) {
        this.quantity_of_purchase = quantity_of_purchase;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }
    
    public double getInvoiceAmount(){
        
        return quantity_of_purchase*price;
    }
   
    }

OUTPUT:
