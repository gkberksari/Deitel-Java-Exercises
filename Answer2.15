(Arithmetic) Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains them
from the user and prints their sum, product, difference and quotient (division).


import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewMain {

public static void main (String []args){

    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    System.out.println("Hello! This program will show sum,product,difference and divison of two integers that you entered. ");
    System.out.println("Please enter two integers");
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b = scan.nextInt();
    
    System.out.println("Sum: "+ (a+b) +"\nProduct: "+ (a*b) +"\nDifference: "+ (a-b) +"\nDivison: "+ (a/b));
    
    }

}




OUTPUT:

Hello! This program will show sum,product,difference and divison of two integers that you entered. 
Please enter two integers
