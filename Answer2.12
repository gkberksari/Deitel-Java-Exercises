Given that y = ax3 + 7, which of the following are correct Java statements for this equation?
a) y = a * x * x * x + 7;
b) y = a * x * x * (x + 7);
c) y = (a * x) * x * (x + 7);
d) y = (a * x) * x * x + 7;
e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7; 
f) y = a * x * (x * x + 7); 




Just like algebraic operations...
a,d and e.
