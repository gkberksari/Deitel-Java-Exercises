(Comparing Integers) Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains
them from the user and displays the larger number followed by the words "is larger". If the numbers are equal, print the message "These numbers are equal". 



import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewMain {

public static void main (String []args){

    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    System.out.println("Hello! This program will show the comparison of the integers that you entered.");
    System.out.println("Please enter two integers");
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b = scan.nextInt();
    
   if(a>b){
   System.out.println("First number is larger.");
          }
   
   else if(a<b){
   System.out.println("Second number is larger.");
               }
   else{
   System.out.println("These numbers are equal");
       }
                     }

              }
