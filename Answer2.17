(Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write an application that inputs three integers from the
user and displays the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. Use the techniques
shown in Fig. 2.15. [Note: The calculation of the average in this exercise should result in an integer
representation of the average. So, if the sum of the values is 7, the average should be 2, not
2.3333â€¦.]


import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewMain {

public static void main (String []args){

    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    System.out.println("Hello! This program will show the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers that you entered.");
    System.out.println("Please enter three integers");
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    int b = scan.nextInt();
    int c = scan.nextInt();
    
    if(a<b && a<c){
        System.out.println("The smallest number is "+a);        
    }
    
    else if(b<a && b<c){
        System.out.println("The smallest number is "+b);
    }
    
    else{
        System.out.println("The smallest number is "+c);
    }
    
    System.out.println("Avarage is: "+(a+b+c)/3);
    System.out.println("Sum is: "+ (a+b+c));
    System.out.println("Product is: "+(a*b*c));
    
    if(a>b && a>c){
        System.out.println("The largest number is "+a); 
    }
    else if(b>a && b>c){
        System.out.println("The largest number is "+b); 
    }
    else{
        System.out.println("The largest number is "+c); 
    }
    
  
        }

}







OUTPUT:
Hello! This program will show the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers that you entered.
Please enter three integers
3
7
9
The smallest number is 3
Avarage is: 6
Sum is: 19
Product is: 189
The largest number is 9
