(World Population Growth Calculator) Use the web to determine the current world population and the annual world population growth rate.
Write an application that inputs these values, then displays the estimated world population after one, two, three, four and five years.





import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewMain{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
       Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
     System.out.println("This is a sample world population growth calculator");
     System.out.println("Enter the annual growth rate in percent: ");
     double gr = scan.nextDouble();
     long population=7794798759L;
     double fy = gr/100*population+population;
     double sy = gr/100*fy+fy;
     double ty = gr/100*sy+sy;
     double foy = gr/100*ty+ty;
     double fiy = gr/100*foy+foy;
     
     System.out.printf("\nFirst year: %.0f",fy);
     System.out.printf("\nSecond year: %.0f",sy);
     System.out.printf("\nThird year: %.0f",ty);
     System.out.printf("\nFourth year: %.0f",foy);
     System.out.printf("\nFifthyear: %.0f",fiy);
    }
}





OUTPUT:

This is a sample world population growth calculator
Enter the annual growth rate in percent: 
1,05

First year: 7876644146
Second year: 7959348910
Third year: 8042922073
Fourth year: 8127372755
