(Employee Class) Create a class called Employee that includes three instance variables—a
first name (type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. 
Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value.
Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each
object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary
again.


public class Employee {
    
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    
    public Employee(String name, double salary){
        this.name = name;
        if(salary>0)
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        if(salary>0)
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    
    public double yearlySalary(){
        return salary*12;
    }
    
    public void raise(double percent_amount_of_raise) {
        salary = salary + (percent_amount_of_raise/100)*salary;
    }
}







public class EmployeeTest {

   
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Employee employee1 = new Employee("Gokberk",4250.0);
        Employee employee2 = new Employee("Mehmet",-200.0);
        System.out.println("employee1 name : "+employee1.getName()+"\nemployee1 monthly salary: "+employee1.getSalary());
        System.out.println("\nemployee2 name : "+employee2.getName()+"\nemployee2 monthly salary: "+employee2.getSalary());
        
        System.out.println("\n\nYearly salary of employee1: "+employee1.yearlySalary());
        
        System.out.println("Now we give 10% raise for employee1");
        employee1.raise(10);
        System.out.println("Current salary of employee1 : "+employee1.getSalary()+"\nCurrent yearly salary : "+employee1.yearlySalary());
    }
    
}




OUTPUT:

employee1 name : Gokberk
employee1 monthly salary: 4250.0

employee2 name : Mehmet
employee2 monthly salary: 0.0


Yearly salary of employee1: 51000.0
Now we give 10% raise for employee1
Current salary of employee1 : 4675.0
Current yearly salary : 56100.0
