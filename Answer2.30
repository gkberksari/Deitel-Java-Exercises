(Separating the Digits in an Integer) Write an application that inputs one number consisting of five digits from the user,
separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits
separated from one another by three spaces each. For example, if the user types in the number 42339, the program should print 
4    2    3    3     9
Assume that the user enters the correct number of digits. What happens when you enter a
number with more than five digits? What happens when you enter a number with fewer than five
digits?



import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewMain{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
  
        System.out.println("Hello! This program will seperate the digits of the number that you entered");
        System.out.println("Please enter an integer with 5 digits...   ");
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        //35467
        System.out.println(n/10000+"   "+(n/1000)%10+"   "+(n/100)%10+"   "+(n/10)%10+"   "+n%10);
        
    }
}
