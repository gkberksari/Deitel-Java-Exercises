An instance variable is declared private in a class so that only the methods of the class in which the instance variable is declared can manipulate it.
This prevents it from being accidentally modified by a class in another part of the program.
In some situations you might need to retrieve that information in a different part of the program so you would use SET and GET to make it public and modify that private data.
