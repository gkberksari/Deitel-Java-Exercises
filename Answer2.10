Assuming that x = 2 and y = 3, what does each of the following statements display? 
a) System.out.printf("x = %d%n", x);
b) System.out.printf("Value of %d + %d is %d%n", x, x, (x + x));
c) System.out.printf("x =");
d) System.out.printf("%d = %d%n", (x + y), (y + x));


The OUTPUT is:

x = 2
Value of 2 + 2 is 4
x =5 = 5
