(Diameter, Circumference and Area of a Circle) Here’s a peek ahead. In this chapter, you
learned about integers and the type int. Java can also represent floating-point numbers that contain
decimal points, such as 3.14159. Write an application that inputs from the user the radius of a circle
as an integer and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and area using the floating-point value
3.14159 for π. Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.7. [Note: You may also use the predefined
constant Math.PI for the value of π. This constant is more precise than the value 3.14159. Class Math
is defined in package java.lang. Classes in that package are imported automatically, so you do not
need to import class Math to use it.] 
Use the following formulas (r is the radius): diameter = 2r circumference = 2πr area = πr^2
Do not store the results of each calculation in a variable. Rather, specify each calculation as the
value that will be output in a System.out.printf statement. The values produced by the circumference and area calculations are floating-point numbers. 
Such values can be output with the format specifier %f in a System.out.printf statement.



import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewMain{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
  
     //diameter = 2r circumference = 2πr area = πr^2
     System.out.println("Hello! This program will calculate some equations of a circle");
     System.out.println("Please enter the radius value:  ");
     Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
     int r = scan.nextInt();
     double pi = 3.14159;
     
     System.out.println("Diameter is: "+2*r);
     System.out.println("Circumference is: "+2*pi*r);
     System.out.println("Area is: "+pi*r*r);
     
    }
}
