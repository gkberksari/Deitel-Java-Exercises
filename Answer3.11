(Modified Account Class) Modify class Account (Fig. 3.8) to provide a method called withdraw that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed
the Accountâ€™s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the method should print
a message indicating "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance." Modify class AccountTest
(Fig. 3.9) to test method withdraw.

public class Account {
    
   private String name;
   private double balance;

       this.name = name;

OUTPUT:
Gokberk's balance : 25.0

Enter withdraw amount for account2: 
43,5
Withdrawing 43.5 from account2's balance
Gokberk's balance : 70.2
